          <p>Once you have downloaded the AFP, you can include its articles and theories in your own developments. If you would like to make your work available to others <em>without</em> having to include the AFP articles you depend on, here is how to do it.</p>
<p>If you are using Isabelle2020, and have downloaded your AFP directory to <code>/home/myself/afp</code>, you should run the following command <a href="#1">[1]</a> to make the AFP session ROOTS available to Isabelle:</p>
<pre><code>echo &quot;/home/myself/afp/thys&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.isabelle/Isabelle2020/ROOTS
</code></pre>
<p>You can now refer to article <code>ABC</code> from the AFP in some theory of yours via</p>
<pre><code>imports &quot;ABC.Some\_ABC\_Theory&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This allows you to distribute your material separately from any AFP theories. Users of your distribution also need to install the AFP in the above manner.</p>
<p>[1]: Tested for Linux and Mac installations ‚Äê it should be the same under cygwin on Windows.</p>
